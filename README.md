# Eddy Tamayo educia27 JS DOM Manipulation and Fetching Data


This sample is using knowledge about forms, the DOM, and HTTP. With the use of PreventDefault() function to prevent a request from being sent out and the page 
reloading. There is also validation to ensure that the user entered a value for each field. 

Furthermore, I used DOM manipulation to update the CSS stylings. Lastly, I fetch planetary JSON data to update where the shuttle is headed.
